- Work with Hugo as much as possible because it's fast and you don't want to waste your time waiting your javascript transpiling/compiling things.
- Read hugo assets management/assets piping to understand how it works. Just in case there's a way to make your workflow better.
- Clean/purge your css and js assets from unused lines of codes later with javascript
- The main idea is: use the most of Hugo because javascript is slow
